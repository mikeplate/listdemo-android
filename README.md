# ListDemo for Android

This application is a demonstration of lists, dynamic arrays and showing an edit form on the Android
platform. It was used in a course at Technical School of Engineering in Jönköping, Sweden taught by
Mikael Plate. Its purpose is also to compare these operations to how they are done on the iOS
platform.  Therefore, a corresponding similar application is available for iOS at
https://github.com/mikeplate/listdemo-ios.git
